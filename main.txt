1) ping
ipconfig
hostname
ping
tracert -d 
netstat

Ipconfig - This command shows you information about your computer's network
connections, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateway.
Hostname - This command displays the name of your computer on the network.
Ping - This command sends a series of packets to the specified destination to
check network connectivity and measure round-trip times.
Tracert - This command traces the route that packets take to reach the specified
destination, showing each hop along the way and the time it takes to reach each
hop.
Netstat - This command displays network statistics such as active connections,
listening ports, and routing tables on your computer. You can use various options
with Netstat to get specific information, such as "-a" for all connections and
listening ports or "-n" for displaying addresses and port numbers in numerical
form.

2)
copper cross over(same dev) (fastethernet, lan port)
copper straight through(diff dev)

(almost same.)
ping ip
3) star topology
copper straight through
switch.
pcs. connect.
set ip. almost same.

make hub + 3pcs.
#connect hub and switch. copper cross over. (this is not needed)
then send message.

4)To create Bus, Ring, Tree, Hybrid, Mesh topologies 
bus:
just take 4 pc, 4 switches.
connect all switch. cross over.
switch and pc, straight.
connect the switches in a line. then with each switch, connect a pc.
set ip. same ip.
Ring:
just make a ring of the switches.
and same.
hypbrid:
connect any two.
mesh:
same as ring, connect the switches everywhere. cross in btween.
tree:
make a tree like struct. num of pc = num of switches.
pc is above switch.

5) Perform an initial Switch configuration:
set switch 
take a pc
connect it using console cable. take rs.
go to terminal
press enter
configure terminal
hostname name
enable password pass
enable secret pass
6)Perform an initial Router configuration
same as switch.
enable.
configure terminal
hostname name
enable password pass
enable secret pass
interface vlan 1
ip address <10.0.0.1 255.0.0.0>
no shutdown

7)implement Client Server Network
take pcs. take 1 server. take 1 switch.
the switch is like a hub.
connect using straight through
go to cli
server->config->fastethernet. set ip. 
server->services->dhcp-> set default gateway as same ip. and trun on services. save.
server->config->settings->gateway:ip.
in comp ip, change ip config to dhcp.
go to pc, desktop, http://practical.com


8)implement the connection between devices using a router

router, 2 pc, copper cross over
set ip. almsot same. 192.187.1.2 and 2.2
router->config->fastethernert turn on, then ip adress for whaever pc you connect(1.1). same with fastethernet(0/1)(2.1)
set default gateway in pcs as the router.

9)perform remote desktop sharing within a LAN connection
switch.
2 pcs, almost same ip.(1.2,1.3)
go to router cli
enable
config terminal
interface vlan 1
ip address 192.168.1.1
no shutdown
exit
line vty 0 4
login local
user cisco password cisco
enable password cisco

telnet 192.168.1.1
config terminal.
